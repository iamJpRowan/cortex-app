[Docs](../README.md) / Backlog

# Backlog

This directory contains feature backlog items for Cortex development. Each file represents a discrete feature or enhancement that can be implemented independently.

## Structure

Backlog items are organized as standalone markdown files. Each file contains:
- **Goal**: What the feature aims to achieve
- **Constraints and Requirements**: Prerequisites, functional requirements, and limitations
- **Approach**: High-level strategy for implementation
- **Architectural Choices**: Predetermined technical decisions and patterns
- **Success Criteria**: How to verify the feature is complete

## Current Backlog

- **[ollama-connection.md](./ollama-connection.md)** - Integrate local Ollama installation and connection
- **[test-ui-panel.md](./test-ui-panel.md)** - Extend test panel UI for Neo4j and Ollama testing
- **[vault-integration.md](./vault-integration.md)** - Configure vault path and enable manual sync verification

## Usage

These backlog items provide feature-level context without implementation details, making them suitable for:
- Planning and estimation
- Understanding dependencies between features
- Architectural decision reference
- Feature prioritization

## Future Backlog Items

As the project progresses, additional backlog items will be added here for:
- Phase 1 features (chat interface, LLM query generation, etc.)
- Use case implementations
- Automation candidates
- Technical improvements
