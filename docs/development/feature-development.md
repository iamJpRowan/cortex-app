# Feature Development

When implementing new features, follow the workflow defined in [use-case-workflow.md](./use-case-workflow.md).

**Quick summary:**
1. Pick ONE specific example from a use case document
2. Implement through phases: Chat → UI → Integration → Automation docs
3. Pause at decision points for human guidance
4. Create working increments, not perfection

See [use-case-workflow.md](./use-case-workflow.md) for complete details on each phase, success criteria, and common patterns.
