# Automation Candidates

This directory contains documented automation opportunities discovered during Phase 4 of the use case workflow.

## Purpose

Automation candidates are patterns that have been:
- Performed manually multiple times (3+)
- Proven valuable and consistent
- Documented for future implementation

## Creating a New Candidate

Use the [TEMPLATE.md](./TEMPLATE.md) to document new automation opportunities.

## When to Implement

Automation candidates are documented but not immediately implemented. Implementation should happen when:
- The pattern has been proven valuable through repeated manual use
- The automation risk is low
- The value clearly outweighs the implementation cost
