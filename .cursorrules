# Cursor AI Rules

For detailed collaboration patterns and development practices, see:
- **[AGENTS.md](docs/AGENTS.md)** - How to work with developers (conversation workflow, pacing, when to pause)
- **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** - Development guardrails and technical constraints

## Quick Preferences

- Follow the structured conversation workflow: Goal → Steps → Propose → Discuss → Implement → Test → Commit
- Favor concise explanations; provide detail only when asked
- Pause and clarify when requirements are ambiguous - never assume
- Stop immediately if agreed approach won't work; explain and ask how to proceed
- Follow conventions from [DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for all file operations
